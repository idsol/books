This unique book, for web designers and developers, will take you through what can be done with JavaScript (and especially with jQuery) in Drupal 6.\r\n\r\nWith the combination of the powerhouse jQuery library with its own robust set of JavaScript tools, Drupal 6 comes with a pre-packaged killer JavaScript environment. Cross-platform by nature, it provides all of the tools necessary to create powerful AJAX-enabled scripts, gorgeous visual effects, and view-enhancing behaviors. In addition, Drupal developers have ported some of its most powerful PHP tools – like a theming engine and support for localization and language translation – to JavaScript, making it possible to write simple scripts where once only complex PHP code could be used.\r\n\r\nThis book gives you the keys to the toolbox, showing you how to use Drupal’s JavaScript libraries to make your modules and themes more dynamic, interactive and responsive, and add effects to make your Drupal site explode into life!\r\n\r\nIf you’ve dipped your toe in the water of theme or module development with Drupal 6, this is the book you want to make the look and behavior of your work something special. With it’s project-based approach, this book is carefully constructed to guide you from how JavaScript fits into the overall Drupal architecture through to making you a master of the jQuery library in the world of Drupal themes and modules.\r\n\r\nWhat you will learn from this book?\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>An introduction to JavaScript in Drupal 6</li>\r\n    <li>The basics of the jQuery library</li>\r\n    <li>Creating JavaScript-enabled themes</li>\r\n    <li>Manipulating a page on the fly with jQuery</li>\r\n    <li>Authoring simple PHPTemplate files designed to maximize scripting potential</li>\r\n    <li>Using jQuery to add effects in Drupal 6</li>\r\n    <li>Working with Drupal 6 behaviors</li>\r\n    <li>Adding AJAX to modules</li>\r\n    <li>Using Drupal’s localization and language translation engine in your JavaScript</li>\r\n    <li>Theming on the client-side with Drupal’s JavaScript theme engine</li>\r\n    <li>Building better forms</li>\r\n    <li>Working with Drupal 6’s JavaScript library</li>\r\n    <li>Writing portable JavaScript tools as Drupal modules</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nApproach\r\n\r\nThis book focuses on teaching by example.

No experience of creating themes or modules is required.\r\n\r\nYou will need to know the basics of client-side web development; this means HTML, CSS, but also have a rudimentary grasp of the syntax of JavaScript. Familiarity with PHP programming will be an advantage, since we will be writing PHPTemplate files and (at the end) creating Drupal modules. However, the PHP is covered thoroughly enough that even the PHP neophyte will not find the text too demanding.

That’s because C# is not only essential for making .NET work, it’s a big way for Microsoft to attract millions of Java, C and C++ developers to the platform. And C# has definitely made some inroads. Because of its popularity among developers, the language received standardization from ECMA International, making it possible to port C# applications to other platforms. To bolster its appeal, C# 2.0 has undergone some key changes as part of Visual Studio 2005 that will make development with .NET quicker and easier. That’s precisely what Visual C# 2005: A Developer’s Notebook allows you to do. There are some great new features in C# and this unique “all lab, no lecture” guide covers them all with 50 hands-on projects. Each project explores a new feature, with emphasis on changes that increase productivity, simplify programming tasks, and add functionality to applications. C#’s component-based design combines the productivity of Microsoft’s popular Visual Basic with the raw power of C++ for web-based applications. Many reviewers note a similarity between C# and Java–in fact, a new feature that took the Java development team five years to incorporate into Java is now available in C# 2.0. Called “generics”, this feature enables developers to reuse and customize their existing code, so they can dramatically cut down the time it takes to develop new applications. Visual C# 2005: A Developer’s Notebook is full of no-nonsense code without the usual page-filling commentary. You’ll find suggestions for further experimentation, links to on-line documentation, plus practical notes and warnings.

It is this desire to stay ahead that drove us to seek a deep understanding of first Java, and now C# and .NET.\r\n\r\nWhy We Wrote This Book\r\n\r\nAs Java programmers, we would have found this book useful when starting out with Microsoft .NET and C#. The similarities between C# and Java are immediate and obvious, but there are many challenges to be overcome before a competent Java programmer can become effective with C#. Having faced these challenges, we saw the opportunity to use the similarities and our experience to guide prospective C# developers past the pitfalls and provide a quick route to making effective use of C# and .NET.\r\n\r\nWho Should Read This Book\r\n\r\nTo get the most from this book, the reader should be a Java developer who wants or needs to develop using C# and the Microsoft .NET Framework. Throughout this book, we rely on knowledge of Java to provide an easy path to understanding C# and .NET.\r\n\r\nOrganization of This Book\r\n\r\nWe looked around at the C# books in print when we started developing .NET applications and found that most spend a lot of time introducing concepts that are already known to the Java programmer.\r\n\r\nThroughout this book we have tried to be concise, comprehensive, and accurate. We have not spent time explaining the basics of programming, detailing the evolution of programming languages, or expounding our favored methodologies. We concentrate on C# and .NET, using Java as the basis for comparison, and provide frequent examples and details of how Java and .NET differ.\r\n\r\nPart I: Introducing .NET\r\nThe first part of this book provides a brief overview of the .NET platform and includes a comparison between .NET and Java to provide a context for the later chapters.\r\n\r\nPart II: The C# Language\r\nThe second part of this book consists of a detailed explanation of the syntax and features of the C# language. Java programmers will be comfortable with the majority of the C# syntax and keywords. Part II provides an exhaustive reference for each language feature and explains the differences from Java as required.\r\n\r\nPart III: Programming .NET with C#\r\nPart III discusses how to use C# and the .NET Framework to accomplish common programming tasks, including string and number manipulation, Input/Output, using collections, and dealing with XML. The contents of these chapters will provide the reader with an understanding of the basic .NET facilities and demonstrate how the C# language is applied to program the .NET Framework. After reading Part III, readers should be able to write simple C# applications.\r\n\r\nPart IV: Advanced Topics\r\nPart IV builds on the previous chapters to introduce more advanced programming areas, such as threading, networking, and accessing databases.\r\n','Allen Jones, Adam Freeman','Microsoft Press','2002-09-14',500,'0735617791','CHM',622600,'csharp, .net, java'),(33,'Windows via C/C++, Fifth Edition (Windows核心编程)','Microsoft Windows is a complex operating system. It offers so many features and does so much that it’s impossible for any one person to fully understand the entire system. This complexity also makes it difficult for someone to decide where to start concentrating the learning effort. Well, I always like to start at the lowest level by gaining a solid understanding of the system’s basic building blocks. Once you understand the basics, it’s easy to incrementally add any higher-level aspects of the system to your knowledge. So this book focuses on Windows’ basic building blocks and the fundamental concepts that you must know when architecting and implementing software targeting the Windows operating system. In short, this book teaches the reader about various Windows features and how to access them via the C and C++ programming languages.\r\n\r\nAlthough this book does not cover some Windows concepts—such as the Component Object Model (COM)—COM is built on top of basic building blocks such as processes, threads, memory management, DLLs, thread local storage, Unicode, and so on. If you know these basic building blocks, understanding COM is just a matter of understanding how the building blocks are used. I have great sympathy for people who attempt to jump ahead in learning COM’s architecture. They have a long road ahead and are bound to have gaping holes in their knowledge, which is bound to negatively affect their code and their software development schedules.\r\n\r\nThe Microsoft .NET Framework’s common language runtime (CLR) is another technology not specifically addressed in this book. (However, it is addressed in my other book: CLR via C#, Jeffrey Richter, Microsoft Press, 2006). However, the CLR is implemented as a COM object in a dynamic-link library (DLL) that loads in a process and uses threads to execute code that manipulates Unicode strings that are managed in memory. So again, the basic building blocks presented in this book will help developers writing managed code. In addition, by way of the CLR’s Platform Invocation (P/Invoke) technology, you can call into the various Windows’ APIs presented throughout this book.\r\n\r\nSo that’s what this book is all about: the basic Windows building blocks that every Windows developer (at least in my opinion) should be intimately aware of. As each block is discussed, I also describe how the system uses these blocks and how your own applications can best take advantage of these blocks. In many chapters, I show you how to create building blocks of your own. These building blocks, typically implemented as generic functions or C++ classes, group a set of Windows building blocks together to create a whole that is much greater than the sum of its parts.','Jeffrey Richter ,Christophe Nasarre','Microsoft Press','2008-01-01',0,'未知','CHM',3820000,'cpp, win32'),(34,'C++ Concurrency in Action: Practical Multithreading','With the new C++ Standard and Technical Report 2 (TR2), multi-threading is coming to C++ in a big way.

Using object-oriented principles, you can develop a domain model that all team members-including business experts and technical specialists-can understand. Even better, this model is directly related to the underlying implementation.\r\n\r\nBut if you’ve tried building a domain-driven application then you’ll know that applying the DDD principles is easier said than done. Naked Objects, an open-source Java framework, lets you build working applications simply by writing the core domain classes. Naked Objects automatically renders your domain object in a generic viewer–either rich client or HTML. You can use its integration with Fitnesse to test-drive the development of your application, story-by-story. And once developed, you can deploy your application either to the full Naked Objects runtime, or within your existing application infrastructure.\r\n\r\nIn this book, Dan Haywood first gives you the tools to represent your domain as plain old Java objects, expressing business rules both declaratively and imperatively. Next, you’ll learn the techniques to deepen your design while keeping it maintainable as the scope of your application grows. Finally, you’ll walk through the development practices needed to implement your domain applications, taking in testing, deployment, and extending Naked Objects itself. Throughout the book, you’ll build a complete sample application, learning key DDD principles as you work through the application step by step. Every chapter ends with exercises to gain further experience in your own projects.\r\n\r\nThrough its focus on the core business domain, DDD delivers value to your business stakeholders, and Naked Objects makes using DDD easy to accomplish.

Regardless of database engine, platform, language, or application, developers repeatedly encounter the same relational database access challenges. In Data Access Patterns, Clifton Nock identifies 25 proven solutions, presenting each one in the form of a clear, easy-to-use pattern. These patterns solve an exceptionally wide range of problems including creating efficient database-independent applications, hiding obscure database semantics from users, speeding database resource initialization, simplifying development and maintenance, improving support for concurrency and transactions, and eliminating data access bottlenecks. Every pattern is illustrated with fully commented Java/JDBC code examples, as well as UML diagrams representing interfaces, classes, and relationships.The patterns are organized into five categories: *Decoupling Patterns: Build cleaner, more reliable systems by decoupling data access code from other application logic *Resource Patterns: Manage relational database resources more efficiently *Input/Output Patterns: Simplify I/O operations by translating consistently between “physical” relational data and domain object representations of that data *Cache Patterns: Use caching strategically, to optimize the tradeoffs between data access optimization and cache overhead *Concurrency Patterns: Implement concurrency and transactions more effectively and reliably Data Access Patterns demystifies techniques that have traditionally been used only in the most robust data access solutions–making those techniques practical for every software developer, architect, and designer.','Clifton Nock','Addison Wesley','2003-09-15',512,'0-13-140157-2','CHM',2100000,'database'),(72,'Fundamentals of Database Systems (3rd Edition) (数据库系统基础)','Fundamentals of Database Systems combines clear explanations of theory and design, broad coverage of models and real systems, and excellent examples with up-to-date introductions to modern database technologies.

This book is designed to show you how to use Python (in combination with the raw processing power of your computer) to accomplish real-world tasks in a more efficient way. Don’t look for an exhaustive description of the Python language––you won’t find it. The book’s main purpose is not to thoroughly cover the Python language, but rather to show how you can use Python to create robust, real-world applications.\r\n\r\nIn this respect, the goal is similar to foreign-language books that identify themselves as “conversational,” focusing on the vocabulary and concepts that people will need the most. Likewise, I focus specifically on the Python knowledge needed to accomplish practical, specific tasks. Along the way, you will learn to create useful, efficient scripts that are easy to maintain and enhance.\r\n\r\nThis book is for developers with some experience with Python who want to explore how to develop full-blown applications. It is also for developers with experience in other languages who want to learn Python by building robust applications. It is well-suited for developers who like to “learn by doing,” rather than exploring a language feature by feature. To get the most out of the book, you should understand basic programming principles.\r\n\r\nBecause this book is project-based, you can approach it in numerous ways. You can, of course, read it from cover to cover. Chapters 2 through 8 each cover a different project, so the chapters are independent of each other. However, because each chapter project is covered individually, there may be some overlap of information. I also sometimes refer to explanations of particular topics covered in previous chapters. This will help to reinforce important concepts.\r\n\r\nThe end of the book contains two appendixes. The first one is a listing of Python resources you can check out for more information. The second one will help you with installing additional components used in some of the examples.\r\n\r\nThis book starts with a basic overview of the Python language, designed for those familiar with other languages but new to Python. It is followed by several chapters, each of which describes a complete project that can be used as-is or modified and extended to suit your particular purposes. You’ll find applications that access databases, take advantage of web technologies, and facilitate network communications, to name a few. In addition, and more important than the technologies you will be introduced to, you will learn how to use Python to solve real challenges. Following these chapters are two chapters that cover accessing operating system resources and debugging and testing, respectively.\r\n\r\nEach project chapter contains complete instructions describing how to install and use the application, so you can actually see the program run as you learn how to construct and use it, including how the project was designed and prototyped. This book is intended to be both a reference guide and a learning aid, teaching you how to build solutions with Python and providing reference information on a wide variety of Python programming concepts.\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that this book will help you have fun with Python and build useful applications, and—unlike my experience with building a deck—without sore thumbs.\r\n\r\nThis book is framed around the code itself. This is because developers are typically looking for how to do something; and, as with many activities, you learn how to do something by watching how others do and trying it yourself. If you want to know how a for loop works, you’ll find for loops in my code, but that’s not the thrust of the book. Instead, this book shows you how to do things: how to build a content management system, how to build a test management system, how to set up a system for tracking customer follow-up, and so on. Along the way, you’ll learn how to communicate with a SQL database, how to act as a web server or communicate with one, how to access operating system services, and more.\r\n\r\nThere are three basic components to the book:\r\n\r\n    * Chapter 1 is a brief overview of the Python language.\r\n    * Chapters 2–8 cover seven different programming projects, which illustrate various technologies and techniques available to Python developers.\r\n    * Chapters 9–10 cover additional, advanced topics, which will help you as you build Python projects.\r\n\r\nThe project chapters have a consistent structure:\r\n\r\n    * Overview: What does the application do?\r\n    * Using the program\r\n    * Design\r\n    * How it all fits together\r\n    * Modules involved\r\n    * Code and code explanation\r\n    * Module/class 1 explanation\r\n    * Module/class 2 explanation\r\n    * Minor code file explanation\r\n    * Testing, including suggested tests\r\n    * Modifying the project, including some suggested adaptations\r\n    * Summary\r\n\r\nEach project is designed with classes that can be reused and accessed for multiple purposes. This is one of the main benefits of object-oriented programming, so designing for reusability is a main focus of the book. The book contains the following chapters:\r\n\r\n1. Python Basics\r\n\r\nThis chapter is a basic primer on the Python language, and it functions as either a quick tutorial for experienced programmers new to Python or a refresher for programmers with Python experience.\r\n\r\nPart I: The Projects\r\n\r\n2. Directory/File Snapshot Program\r\n\r\nThis project demonstrates how to interact with files, create and manipulate data structures, and provide user output. It also touches on code design issues to improve code maintainability. Often when installing or uninstalling software, or verifying changes to a file system, it can be valuable to take a “snapshot” of the files and directories, along with their size and last-modified time. The script introduced in this chapter does just that. This chapter also explores how to capture a directory listing into a Python list, and explains how to query this list for particular values.\r\n\r\n3. DVD Inventory System\r\n\r\nThis project takes advantage of Python’s capability to access and manipulate data in a SQL database. The application enables multiple users to log in to a website that provides access to a DVD inventory database. Permissions are set such that some users can add, modify, or delete entries, whereas other users have read-only access to the data.\r\n\r\n4. Web Performance Tester\r\n\r\nThis project shows how to communicate with a Python web server and retrieve information regarding how long it takes to receive requested items from the web server. Although writing Python programs to work on a single computer can be useful, the real power of Python can be seen when it is used to script communication between computers on a network. Most networks contain several web servers. A nice feature of Python is that it can act as a lightweight server for various Internet protocols, such as HTTP (web) and ftp. This application enables you to monitor performance of HTTP traffic on your network.\r\n\r\n5. Customer Follow-Up System\r\n\r\nThis project shows how to present a web form to the user and retrieve data from it, how to automatically format and send e-mail through an SMTP server, and how to generate an HTML-formatted report. The task for the second example is to automatically generate a customer comments e-mail message based on information the customer enters in a form. It uses the mod_python Apache module to take the information entered in the HTTP form and then utilizes a Python script on the web server to send that information to an SMTP server for mail delivery.\r\n\r\n6. Test Management/Reporting System\r\n\r\nThis project makes use of the unittest module to run tests against an existing application, and creates a framework for reporting test results. Testing is a vital process for developing software. This application enables users to run tests for a given piece of software, to list the previous test runs by date, to show test run results for any previously run tests, and to output the results of any test run as HTML for viewing in a web browser.\r\n\r\n7. Version Management System\r\n\r\nThis project connects to a list of servers via telnet, checks the application version of a pre-set application list, and displays its results both as output and to a log file. Often, a system administrator needs to patch systems or ensure that systems have the latest application versions installed. This script is an easy way to accomplish that task. It makes use of Python’s capability to emulate a telnet client and log in to remote systems and perform functions on that remote system.\r\n\r\n8. Content Management System\r\n\r\nThis project explores Plone, a popular content management system based on Python and Zope (a Python-based application server). Because Python is a very mature language, numerous applications have been built on top of it. A great thing about working with Python-based applications is that you get the benefit of a full-blown application but you can still use Python to configure and customize it.\r\n\r\nPart II: Advanced Topics\r\n\r\n9. Interacting with the Operating System\r\n\r\nWhen writing scripts “in the real world,” often it is critical to be able to access services available through (and particular to) the operating system you happen to be on. For example, suppose you wanted to read or modify the Window Registry? Or you wanted to get the Linux process ID of a particular process that is running? Is such a thing even possible? Definitely—and this chapter shows you how.\r\n\r\n10. Debugging and Testing\r\n\r\nBecause I am a software tester myself, testing is a subject that is …','James O.
