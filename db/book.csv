In Detail

JavaScript: It’s not just for calculators and image rollovers.

Drupal 6 is loaded with new features, and not all of them are necessarily implemented in PHP. This unique book, for web designers and developers, will take you through what can be done with JavaScript (and especially with jQuery) in Drupal 6.

With the combination of the powerhouse jQuery library with its own robust set of JavaScript tools, Drupal 6 comes with a pre-packaged killer JavaScript environment. Cross-platform by nature, it provides all of the tools necessary to create powerful AJAX-enabled scripts, gorgeous visual effects, and view-enhancing behaviors. In addition, Drupal developers have ported some of its most powerful PHP tools – like a theming engine and support for localization and language translation – to JavaScript, making it possible to write simple scripts where once only complex PHP code could be used.

This book gives you the keys to the toolbox, showing you how to use Drupal’s JavaScript libraries to make your modules and themes more dynamic, interactive and responsive, and add effects to make your Drupal site explode into life!

If you’ve dipped your toe in the water of theme or module development with Drupal 6, this is the book you want to make the look and behavior of your work something special. With it’s project-based approach, this book is carefully constructed to guide you from how JavaScript fits into the overall Drupal architecture through to making you a master of the jQuery library in the world of Drupal themes and modules.

Approach

This book focuses on teaching by example. Chapters are packed with example code, providing hands-on examples you can play with and then release to your own Drupal sites. By introducing short projects interspersed with discussion, the pace is rapid yet practical.

Who this book is written for?

This book is for web designers and developers who want to add JavaScript elements to Drupal themes or modules to create more flexible and responsive user interfaces.

You are expected to know about the basic operation of Drupal, and be familiar with the concept of theming and modules in Drupal. No experience of creating themes or modules is required.

You will need to know the basics of client-side web development; this means HTML, CSS, but also have a rudimentary grasp of the syntax of JavaScript. Familiarity with PHP programming will be an advantage, since we will be writing PHPTemplate files and (at the end) creating Drupal modules. However, the PHP is covered thoroughly enough that even the PHP neophyte will not find the text too demanding. The book also covers the jQuery JavaScript library and its use in Drupal, but no knowledge of jQuery is expected – you will learn everything you need in this book.

In Detail

To make PHP applications that respond quickly, avoid unnecessary page reloads, and provide great user interfaces, often requires complex JavaScript techniques and even then, if you get that far, they might not even work across different browsers! With jQuery, you can use one of the most popular JavaScript libraries, forget about cross-browser issues, and simplify the creation of very powerful and responsive interfaces – all with the minimum of code.
This is the first book in the market that will ease the server-side PHP coder into the client-side world of the popular jQuery JavaScript library.

This book will show you how to use jQuery to enhance your PHP applications, with many examples using jQuery’s user interface library jQuery UI, and other examples using popular jQuery plugins. It will help you to add exciting user interface features to liven up your PHP applications without having to become a master of client-side JavaScript.

This book will teach you how to use jQuery to create some really stunning effects, but without you needing to have in-depth knowledge of how jQuery works. It provides you with everything you need to build practical user interfaces for everything from graphics manipulation to drag-and-drop to data searching, and much more. The book also provides practical demonstrations of PHP and jQuery and explains those examples, rather than starting from how JavaScript works and how it is different from PHP.

By the end of this book, you should be able to take any PHP application you have written, and transform it into a responsive, user-friendly interface, with capabilities you would not have dreamed of being able to achieve, all in just a few lines of JavaScript.

What you will learn from this book?

    * Integrate jQuery into your PHP applications
    * Add tabs and accordions using the jQuery-UI project to make your pages easier to read

–Björn Karlsson, Principle Architect, ReadSoft; author of Beyond the C++ Standard Library: An Introduction to Boost

In Extended STL, renowned C++ expert Matthew Wilson shows how to go beyond the C++ standard and extend the Standard Template Library into the wider C++ world of APIs and non-standard collections, to write software that is more efficient, expressive, flexible, and robust.

In Volume 1, Wilson’s innovative techniques help you master STL extension in two important areas: adapting technology-specific libraries and operating system APIs to STL-compliant collections, and defining sophisticated iterator adaptors with which the latent efficiency and expressive power of STL can be realized. Using real-world examples, Wilson illustrates several powerful concepts and techniques that enable you to extend STL in directions never envisioned by its creators, including collections, element reference categories, external iterator invalidation and inferred interface adaptation.

Extended STL, Volume 1, will be an invaluable resource for every C++ programmer who is at least minimally familiar with the STL.

    * Learn specific principles and techniques for STL extension
    * Learn more about the STL by looking inside the implementation of STL extensions

15,"C++ in a Nutshell","C++ in a Nutshell packs an enormous amount of information on C++ (and the many libraries used with it) in an indispensable quick reference for those who live in a deadline-driven world and need the facts but not the frills. The book’s language reference is organized first by topic, followed by an alphabetical reference to the language’s keywords, complete with syntax summaries and pointers to the topic references. The library reference is organized by header file, and each library chapter and class declaration presents the classes and types in alphabetical order for easy lookup. Cross-references link related methods, classes, and other key features. This is an ideal resource for students as well as professional programmers. When you’re programming, you need answers to questions about language syntax, or parameters required by library routines quickly. C++ in a Nutshell is a concise desktop reference that answers these questions, putting the full power of this flexible, adaptable (but somewhat difficult to master) language at every C++ programmer’s fingertips.","Ray Lischner","O'Reilly","2003-05-01",808,"978-0596002985","CHM",1160000,"cpp"

18,"C++ Cookbook ","Despite its highly adaptable and flexible nature, C++ is also one of the more complex programming languages to learn. Once mastered, however, it can help you organize and process information with amazing efficiency and quickness.
The “C++ Cookbook” will make your path to mastery much shorter. This practical, problem-solving guide is ideal if you’re an engineer, programmer, or researcher writing an application for one of the legions of platforms on which C++ runs. The algorithms provided in “C++ Cookbook” will jump-start your development by giving you some basic building blocks that you don’t have to develop on your own.

Less a tutorial than a problem-solver, the book addresses many of the most common problems you’re likely encounter–whether you’ve been programming in C++ for years or you’re relatively new to the language. Here are just some of the time-consuming tasks this book contains practical solutions for:

Reading the contents of a directory

Creating a singleton class

Date and time parsing/arithmetic

String and text manipulation

Working with files

Parsing XML

Using the standard containers

Typical of O’Reilly’s “Cookbook” series, “C++ Cookbook” is written in a straightforward format, featuring recipes that contain problem statements and code solutions, and apply not to hypothetical situations, but those that you’re likely to encounter. A detailed explanation then follows each recipe in order to show you how and why the solution works. This question-solution-discussion format is a proven teaching method, as any fan of the “Cookbook” series can attest to. This book will move quickly to the top of your list of essential C++ references.","Jeff Cogswell, Christopher Diggins, Ryan Stephens, Jonathan Turkanis","O'Reilly","2005-11-01",592,"0-596-00761-2","CHM",856290,"cpp"
19,"The C++ Standard Library: A Tutorial and Reference","C++ Standard Library provides a set of common classes and interfaces that greatly extend the core C++ language. The library, however, is not self-explanatory. To make full use of its components-and to benefit from their power-you need a resource that does far more than list the classes and their functions.
The C++ Standard Library not only provides comprehensive documentation of each library component, it also offers clearly written explanations of complex concepts, describes the practical programming details needed for effective use, and gives example after example of working code.
This thoroughly up-to-date book reflects the newest elements of the C++ standard library incorporated into the full ANSI/ISO C++ language standard. In particular, the text focuses on the Standard Template Library (STL), examining containers, iterators, function objects, and STL algorithms. You will also find detailed coverage of special containers, strings, numerical classes, internationalization, and the IOStream library. Each component is presented in depth, with an introduction to its purpose and design, examples, a detailed description, traps and pitfalls, and the exact signature and definition of its classes and their functions. An insightful introduction to fundamental concepts and an overview of the library will help bring newcomers quickly up to speed.
Comprehensive, detailed, readable, and practical, The C++ Standard Library is the C++ resource you will turn to again and again.","Nicolai M. Josuttis","Addison Wesley","1999-08-06",832,"0-201-37926-0","CHM",3370000,"cpp"
